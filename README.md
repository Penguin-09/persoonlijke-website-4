## ✏️ Dependencies

This Project depends on TailwindCSS for styling, but installing Tailwind is not required to host the website. It's only required if you want to make changes to the CSS file.

## ⚙️ Installation

1. Run `npm install tailwindcss @tailwindcss/cli` in the public folder to install Tailwind.

2. To update the output.css file automatically when the input.css file is changed, run `npx @tailwindcss/cli -i ./src/input.css -o ./src/output.css --watch` in the 'public/' folder.
